# Plant Disease Classifier 🌱

## Introduction 📖
Plant Disease Classifier is an AI-based tool 🤖 designed to identify and classify diseases in plants 🌿 using images. This project aims to assist farmers 🚜, gardeners 🌻, and agricultural professionals 🌾 in early disease detection, thereby facilitating timely intervention and treatment to prevent crop loss.

## Features 🌟
- **Disease Identification:** Utilizes advanced machine learning models to accurately identify various plant diseases. 🔍
- **User-friendly Interface:** Easy to use interface for uploading plant images and receiving diagnosis results. 🖥️

## Getting Started 🚀
### Prerequisites
Before you can run Plant Disease Classifier, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher 🐍
- Pip package manager 📦

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VirajBhagiya/Plant-Disease-Classifier.git
cd Plant-Disease-Classifier
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🚀

This project consists of a Python backend and a Node.js frontend. To get the full functionality, you'll need to start both components.

### Starting the Backend

1. Open a terminal window in the project directory.
2. Run the Python backend using:

```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the backend server, which handles the plant disease classification.

Starting the Frontend
Open another terminal window in the project directory.
Navigate to the frontend directory (if your project is structured this way; adjust the command according to your project's structure):
```bash
cd path/to/frontend
```
Install the necessary Node.js dependencies (only needed the first time or when dependencies change):
```bash
npm install
```
Start the frontend application with:
```bash
npm run start
```
This command launches the web interface, allowing users to interact with the Plant Disease Classifier through a web browser.
Make sure both the backend and frontend are running; you should now be able to access the application through your web browser by visiting the address provided by the npm run start command, typically http://localhost:3000 or another port if specified.
